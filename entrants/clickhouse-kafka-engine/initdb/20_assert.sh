# Config glue only — this script reads back what the config claims and exits
# non-zero on any mismatch, which kills the official entrypoint (it runs
# initdb under `set -eo pipefail`) and therefore REFUSES the container start.
# It is not pipeline code: everything it checks was set declaratively in
# config.d/ and users.d/, and the pipeline itself is the three objects
# initdb/10_ddl.sql creates.
#
# Why it exists: every failure below is otherwise SILENT. An env var that
# from_env never carried leaves the inline default in force; a renamed
# setting leaves the shipped default in force; a mistyped cluster host
# forwards into a connection-refused loop — and each produces a plausible,
# wrong number instead of an error. The convention across this benchmark is
# that settings are asserted to have taken effect, not assumed to.
#
# Runs against the entrypoint's init server (localhost-only, same config the
# real server then starts with), as user `default` — the same user the
# pipeline's objects belong to, so the session settings read back here are
# the pipeline's.
