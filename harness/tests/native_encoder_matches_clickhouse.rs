//! The Native encoder, proven against a live ClickHouse rather than against
//! itself.
//!
//! `harness/src/ceiling.rs` writes ClickHouse's Native block format so that the
//! ingest ceiling can cover the arms that write it — which is every headline arm
//! of this benchmark's own vendor. That encoder cannot be trusted because it was
//! written carefully. A Native block that is subtly wrong does not fail loudly:
//! a `LowCardinality` index width one step too narrow truncates the indexes past
//! the boundary and lands the *wrong dictionary entry* in those rows, and the
//! server accepts the block. A ceiling measured against that is worse than no
//! ceiling, because the refusal it replaced was at least honest.
//!
//! # The oracle is the corpus, not a round trip
//!
//! The unit tests in `ceiling.rs` decode a block with a reference decoder
//! written beside the encoder, which proves the bytes are internally consistent
//! and proves nothing about whether ClickHouse reads them the same way. So this
//! file does not check bytes at all. It POSTs blocks at a real server, under the
//! **committed** `workload/clickhouse/ddl.sql`, and then runs
//! [`corpus::run_gates`] — the same closed-form gate every published arm is held
//! to. A block whose landed rows satisfy row identity, both value sums, the
//! `sensor`/`region`/name/`unit`/`tags` fingerprints, the `DateTime64` scaling
//! and the null-`quality` count has been checked against the same oracle, by the
//! same query, as the arms the ceiling exists to gate.
//!
//! That is a far stronger statement than "our decoder agrees with our encoder",
//! and it is stronger in the specific direction that matters: the fingerprint
//! sums are exactly what notices a `LowCardinality` column that landed real
//! strings in the wrong rows.
//!
//! RowBinary runs through the identical path as a **control**. It is already
//! trusted and already measured, so if it fails here the fault is in this file's
//! rig — the container, the DDL, the gate window — rather than in the encoder
//! under test. Without it, a rig bug would read as a Native defect.
//!
//! JSONEachRow and ArrowStream run through the same path for the same reason
//! Native does: each carries encoding decisions a unit test cannot prove the
//! server shares — that a numeric-epoch `DateTime64` is read digit-by-digit and
//! timezone-free, that a full-width `UInt64` survives the JSON number path,
//! that `Utf8` casts onto `LowCardinality` and an Arrow `Timestamp` with
//! `"UTC"` metadata lands tick-for-tick. Their ceilings are not committed until
//! this file has passed for them; the encoders in `ceiling.rs` say so.
//!
//! # Running it
//!
//! These tests need a Docker daemon and pull `clickhouse/clickhouse-server:26.3`,
//! so they are `#[ignore]`d and `cargo test` does not run them. To run them:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo test --package spate-benchmark-harness \
//!     --test native_encoder_matches_clickhouse -- --ignored
//! ```
//!
//! Each test brings up its **own** container on its own port and removes it on
//! the way out, including on a panic, so they are safe to run in parallel and
//! leave nothing behind. That costs a few container starts and buys the property
//! that a failure names one format rather than one shared fixture.
//!
//! This is the repository's first Docker-requiring test. If you add another,
//! copy the shape: a guard value constructed before anything is started, a
//! `Drop` that cleans up, a distinct container name and port, and `#[ignore]`
//! with the command to run it in the doc comment.
