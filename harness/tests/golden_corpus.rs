//! The corpus is pinned by fingerprint, not merely by round-trip.
//!
//! Every other corpus test proves the generator agrees with *itself* — that
//! `encode_batch` and the typed decoder are mutual inverses, that the flatten
//! agrees with the closed-form expectations. None of them would notice if the
//! whole corpus shifted, because they would shift with it. A published
//! comparison cannot afford that: the corpus is the thing every arm is measured
//! against, and if it changes silently then two result sets are being compared
//! across different inputs while claiming to be like-for-like.
//!
//! So these values are absolute. The encoding fingerprints and the first three
//! closed-form expectations were taken from the pre-extraction harness
//! (`etl-rs/benchmarks/src/comparison_data.rs` at `f41280d51165`) and asserted
//! here unchanged, which is what proves the move between repositories did not
//! alter a single byte of what is being measured. The remaining closed-form
//! expectations pin columns the pre-extraction gate never checked, so they have
//! no earlier value to be carried forward from and are pinned from here on.
//!
//! **If one of these fails, do not update the constant to match.** Either the
//! generator changed — in which case `workload/workload.toml`, the schema, the
//! DDL or the marked region of `harness/src/corpus.rs` moved and
//! `dataset_version` must move with it, splitting the comparability group — or
//! something changed that should not have. Both need a human.
