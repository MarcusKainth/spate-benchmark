//! The measurement harness for the Spate streaming ETL benchmark.
//!
//! Everything a published number depends on lives here, and nothing here depends
//! on any system under test. That direction of dependency is the point: a
//! competitor must be able to audit how they were measured without trusting the
//! code of the system they are being compared against.
//!
//! The modules split along the same seam as the repository:
//!
//! - [`report`] — the versioned record. What gets published.
//! - [`validate`] — the rules a committed record has to satisfy, as one function
//!   so that `bench validate` and anything gating a pull request check the same
//!   thing rather than two implementations of it.
//! - [`corpus`] — the deterministic data, as a pure function of `batch_id`.
//! - [`ceiling`] — what the broker and ClickHouse can absorb, measured, and the
//!   refusal to gate against a measurement that does not describe this corpus.
//! - [`inserter`] — the ceiling pass's ClickHouse inserter, run from inside the
//!   bench network so that it crosses the same boundary an arm's inserts do.
//! - [`fetcher`] — the ceiling pass's broker consumer, inside the network for
//!   the same reason and to the same effect: twenty-four times the message rate
//!   the published port served.
//! - [`sampler`] — cgroup v2 measurement from outside the container under test.
//! - [`docker`], [`http`] — plumbing.
//!
//! `methodology/` is normative. Where this code and that document disagree,
//! the document is what the competitor implementations were written against, so
//! the code is wrong.

// The driver narrates progress on stderr by design: a 30-hour sweep that says
// nothing until it finishes is unusable.
