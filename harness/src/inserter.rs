//! The ceiling pass's inserter, run from **inside** the bench network.
//!
//! # The confounder this module closes
//!
//! The ClickHouse ingest ceiling used to be POSTed from the harness process on
//! macOS, through Docker Desktop's published port. Every arm inserts
//! container-to-container over [`NETWORK`] and never crosses that boundary, so
//! the two are not the same insert and the ceiling was measuring the rig.
//!
//! Four independent readings said so, all taken on this host:
//!
//! * Every format and tier plateaued at 246–264 MB/s **on the wire** regardless
//!   of how wide its rows were — a byte wall, not a row wall.
//! * ClickHouse's own `system.query_log` attributed 84.9% (tier A) and 85.5%
//!   (tier B) of total insert duration to `NetworkReceiveElapsed`: the server
//!   was blocked reading the request body. Per insert that was 697ms of duration
//!   against 5.7ms of user and 17.3ms of system CPU.
//! * The ClickHouse container sat at 270–315% of its 500% CPU cap at the
//!   plateau. A target that is not saturated is not the thing being measured.
//! * A direct probe — same statement, same concurrency, 800 MB, `ENGINE = Null`
//!   — gave 274–279 MB/s from the host through the published port and
//!   2,598–3,126 MB/s from a container on [`NETWORK`]. Roughly ten times.
//!
//! So the inserter moved to the side of the boundary the arms are on. What it
//! costs is a container and a pipe protocol; what it buys is that the number is
//! about ClickHouse.
//!
//! # Why a Python program fed to a stock image
//!
//! The same shape [`crate::sampler`] uses, and for the same reason: a
//! measurement should not need a purpose-built image, because an image is a
//! thing to build, to version and to get wrong. `python:3.12-alpine` is pulled
//! once and nothing about it is under measurement.
//!
//! The one departure from the sampler is where the program travels. The sampler
//! feeds its source on stdin and `python3 -` reads stdin until EOF, which leaves
//! no stdin for anything else. This inserter needs stdin twice over — once for
//! tens of megabytes of pre-encoded blocks and then for a command per rung of
//! the sweep — so the program goes in `python3 -c` and stdin carries only data.
//!
//! Python is not the constraint, which was checked rather than assumed. With the
//! request shape below, against `ENGINE = Null` so the server does nothing but
//! read, this program reached 3.3–4.2 GB/s from a container on [`NETWORK`] at
//! 8–32 concurrent inserters: an order of magnitude above the wall the host-side
//! rig hit, and above the throughput the target itself sustains once it has to
//! parse, sort, compress and write what it is sent.
//!
//! # What is deliberately unchanged
//!
//! The request is byte-for-byte the shape [`crate::ceiling`]'s host-side
//! inserter sent: SQL in the query string, the block raw in the body, no
//! compression, `Connection: close`, one connection per POST. Persistent
//! connections were measured beside it and came out inside the noise (3.4–3.8
//! GB/s against 3.3–4.2), so keeping the old shape costs nothing and buys the
//! one thing worth having — the only variable that changed between the figure
//! before this module and the figure after it is which side of Docker's network
//! boundary the bytes came from.
